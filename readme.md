# Bookings Web App

This is a web app based upon a great Udemy course, which is so extensive, and so detailed.


Many thanks to tsawler for his Udemy course - building modern web applications with Golang
(github.com/tsawler/)

This app makes use of:

- Uses [alex edwards scs](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs)
- Uses [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf)
- Uses [chi router](htps://github.com/go-chi/chi)

This app is very much a WIP and will help me locate any wire, plug, powersupply, tools, in fact anything that I store in the Really Useful Storage boxes, which are water tight and air tight. 


Now adding more content to README.MD to see if git pull works.
