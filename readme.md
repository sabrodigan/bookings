# Bookings Web App

This is a web app, which I will use as the basis for my garage boxes-app, which I plan to provide for men like myself, whose entire belomgoinmgs live in storage boxes in the garag.


Many thanks to tsawler for his Udemy course -
(github.com/tsawler/)

This app makes use of:



- Uses [alex edwards scs](https://github.com/alexedwards/scs)
- Uses [nosurf](https://github.com/justinas/nosurf)
- Uses [chi router](htps://github.com/go-chi/chi)

This app is very much a WIP and I will be improving over the next period.  Leadaing to the boxes-app which I hope to launch via social media

Now adding more content to README.MD to see if git pull works.
