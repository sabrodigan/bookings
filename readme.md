# Bookings Web App

This is a web app, which I will use as the basis for my garage boxes-app, which I plan to provide for men like myself, whose entire belomgoinmgs live in storage boxes in the garag.


Many thanks to tsawler for his Udemy course
This app makes use of:



- Uses [alex edwards scs](github.com/alexedwards/scs/V2)
- Uses [nosurf](github.com/justinas/nosurf)
- Uses [chi router](github.com/go-chi/chi)

This app is very much a WIP and I will be improving over the next period.  Leadaing to the boxes-app which I hope to launch via social media
